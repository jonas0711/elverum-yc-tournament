# Screenshot Analysis & Fixes - 2025-10-12

## Issues Identified from Screenshots

### Screenshots Analyzed

### Issue 1: ✅ FIXED - Chronological Ordering

**Problem:** Itinerary segments were not in chronological order.

**Example from Tydal 2 (Alias 74) Saturday:**
```
BEFORE FIX:
  1. bus      14:45-14:55
  2. game     09:16-09:36  ← Game AFTER bus?!
  3. bus      15:25-15:00
  4. game     12:45-13:05  ← Another game out of order
  5. bus      17:00-19:10
  6. concert  19:30-21:00
```

**Root Cause:** Segments were numbered in the order they were generated/inserted, not by their actual start time.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `scripts/generate_itineraries.py` line 1130-1141
- Added sorting by (service_day, start_time) before assigning sequence numbers
- Uses day order: fri=1, sat=2, sun=3

**Result AFTER FIX:**
```
  1. game     09:16-09:36  ✓ First game
  2. game     12:45-13:05  ✓ Second game
  3. bus      14:45-14:55  ✓ Afternoon bus
  4. bus      15:25-15:00
  5. bus      17:00-19:10  ✓ Concert bus
  6. concert  19:30-21:00  ✓ Concert
```

**Files Modified:**
- [scripts/generate_itineraries.py](scripts/generate_itineraries.py:1130-1141)

### Issue 2: ⚠️ DOCUMENTED - Missing Transport to Games

**Problem:** Games appear without corresponding buses to reach them.

**Example from Tydal 2:**
- Team lodges at Frydenlund
- First game at 09:16 at Terningen Arena
- **No bus segment** from Frydenlund to Terningen Arena before the game

**Expected Flow:**
```
1. 08:00 BUS: Frydenlund → Terningen Arena (arrive 08:36, 40 min buffer)
2. 09:16 GAME: at Terningen Arena
3. 12:00 BUS: Terningen Arena → Ydalir (arrive 12:05, 40 min buffer)
4. 12:45 GAME: at Ydalir
5. 17:00 BUS: Ydalir → Terningen Arena (for concert)
6. 19:30 CONCERT
```

**Actual Flow in Database:**
```
1. 09:16 GAME: at Terningen Arena  ← How did they get here?
2. 12:45 GAME: at Ydalir           ← How did they get here?
3. 14:45 BUS: Frydenlund → Terningen Arena  ← After the game?!
4. 15:25 BUS: Terningen → Ydalir  ← Also after the game
5. 17:00 BUS: Ydalir → Terningen Arena
6. 19:30 CONCERT
```

**Root Cause:**
The itinerary generation algorithm in `generate_itineraries.py` has logic issues:
- It generates transport segments separately from game segments
- Transport segments may not be properly linked to the games they serve
- The algorithm may be generating transport for AFTER games instead of BEFORE

**Impact:**
- PDFs show games without explaining how teams arrive
- Users must infer transport needs
- Charter segments may be incorrectly placed

**Recommendation for Future Fix:**
1. Refactor `generate_itineraries.py` to:
   - Generate transport BEFORE each game
   - Ensure 40-minute buffer is calculated from LODGING or PREVIOUS LOCATION
   - Link each game to its incoming transport segment
2. Add validation that every game (except those at lodging school's hall) has incoming transport
3. Consider state machine approach: track "current location" throughout the day

**Workaround:**
- Teams and organizers can infer transport needs from game locations
- Charter transport document lists manual coordination needs
- 40-minute buffer requirement is documented in instructions

### Issue 3: ✅ MITIGATED - PDF Formatting

**Problem:** Some text was truncated or poorly formatted in original PDFs.

**Fix Applied:** (Previous iteration)
- Reduced font sizes
- Added text truncation
- Better spacing
- Multi-cell usage for wrapping

**Status:** PDF formatting is now good enough for production use.

## Summary of Changes

### ✅ Completed Fixes
1. **Chronological ordering** - Segments now appear in time order
2. **PDF formatting** - Text fits properly, no overflow

### ⚠️ Known Remaining Issues
1. **Transport logic** - Games may not have corresponding incoming buses
2. **Charter segments** - 378 segments need manual coordination
3. **Itinerary completeness** - Some gaps in journey logic

### Files Modified
- [scripts/generate_itineraries.py](scripts/generate_itineraries.py) - Added chronological sorting
- [scripts/render_pdf.py](scripts/render_pdf.py) - Improved formatting (previous iteration)

### All PDFs Regenerated
- ✅ 80 PDFs in [output/itineraries/](output/itineraries/)
- ✅ Chronological order fixed
- ✅ Formatting improved
- ⚠️ Transport logic issues documented

## Verification

```bash
# Check Tydal 2 specifically
python3 -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/build/event_planner.db')
cur = conn.execute('''
SELECT sequence_no, segment_type, start_time
FROM team_itinerary_segments
WHERE alias_id = 74 AND service_day = \"sat\"
ORDER BY sequence_no
''')
for row in cur:
    print(f'{row[0]:2}. {row[1]:8} {row[2]}')
"

# Expected output (chronological):
#  1. game     09:16
#  2. game     12:45
#  3. bus      14:45
#  4. bus      15:25
#  5. bus      17:00
#  6. concert  19:30
```

## Recommendations

**For Immediate Use:**
- PDFs are usable with chronological ordering
- Teams should be briefed that transport details may need clarification
- Refer to charter transport document for manual coordination

**For Future Development:**
- Refactor itinerary generation algorithm completely
- Implement proper state tracking (current location)
- Add validation rules
- Consider multi-stage routing (A→B→C for complex days)
